  let welcomeText = '**Welcome to Winter!**  For nearly 20 years, Winter has existed as a community of friends brought together by a love of gaming across genre and platform. We currently support a variety of games on both PC and PlayStation, and maintain this Discord server for communication, planning and hanging out.\n\n'
+ `**Guidelines** - We like a bit of good-natured ribbing, but we\'re not savages. You can find our full community guidelines posted in the ${guidelinesChat} channel, but the short version is "Don\'t be a dick."\n\n`
+ `**winter-bot** - The Winter server uses a custom bot to manage user-joinable roles (game communities) and provide some comic relief now and then. **You can find more information about how to use winter-bot by sending a direct message to ${winterBot} with the word "help"**\n\n`
+ '**Game Communities** - Winter encourages members to organize into communities based on the games they play. Active games with a reasonable community size will usually have their own text channel, and each community has at least one Captain who acts as the advocate, recruiter and organizer.\n'
+ '  • All server users need to add themselves to at least one community role. This allows the community captains to @ mention the community as a whole for important updates.\n'
+ '  • If you do not want game @ mentions at all (for any game community), please add yourself to the role @no_mentions. If you do not, an officer will be adding you to any community they see you active in.\n'
+ `  • **For instructions on how to add yourself to a community, send a direct message to** ${winterBot} **with the word "games".**\n\n`
