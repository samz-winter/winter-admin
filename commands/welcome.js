  let welcomeText = '**Welcome to Winter!**  For nearly 20 years, Winter has existed as a community of friends brought together by a love of gaming across genre and platform. We currently support a variety of games on both PC and PlayStation, and maintain this Discord server for communication, planning and hanging out.\n\n'
+ '**Guidelines** - We like a bit of good-natured ribbing, but we\'re not savages. You can find our full community guidelines posted in the ' + `${guidelinesChat}` + ' channel, but the short version is "Don\'t be a dick."\n\n'
+ '**winter-bot** - The Winter server uses a custom bot to manage user-joinable roles (game communities) and provide some comic relief now and then. You can find more information about how to use winter-bot in the ' + `${botHelpChat}` + ' channel, or you can DM ' + `${winterBot}` + ' with the command `help`\n\n'
+ '**Text Channels** - Text channels are open to all users. Drop in and introduce yourself!\n'
+ '• ' + `${winterGeneralChat}` + ' is our off-topic/hangout chat. Expect shenanigans... and probably lots of "dad jokes."\n'
+ '• All other text channels are labeled by topic. Please keep conversations in their appropriate channels (e.g. anything about Monster Hunter should be posted in ' + `${monsterHunterChat}` + '; anything about music should be posted in ' + `${musicChat}` + ', etc).\n\n'
+ '**Voice Channels** - Voice channels can be used as needed. Just don\'t hang out in there alone; people will think you\'re weird.\n\n'
+ '**Game Communities** - Winter encourages members to organize into communities based on the games they play. Active games with a reasonable community size will usually have their own text channel, and each community has at least one Captain who acts as the advocate, recruiter and organizer.\n'
+ '• If you need to contact a community Captain, you can mention them by role (e.g. ' + `${captainRLRole}` + ').\n'
+ '• See ' + `${botHelpChat}` + ' for instructions on how to add yourself to a game community.\n\n'
