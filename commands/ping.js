New features will be added as needed... and some are hidden, just waiting for unsuspecting users to stumble upon them.\n\n'

  let textPing = '**• Winter Community Text Channels** are titled by topic.  Please keep conversations in their appropriate channels (e.g. anything about Monster Hunter should be posted in ' + `${monsterHunterChat}` + '; anything about music should be posted in ' + `${musicChat}` + ', etc).'

  let communitiesPing = '**• Winter Community Server** encourages members to organize into communities based on the games they play. Active games with a reasonable community size will usually have their own text channel, and each community has at least one Captain who acts as the advocate, recruiter and organizer.\n\n'
+ 'All active members need to add themselves to at least one community role. This allows the community captains to @ mention the community as a whole for important community updates.\n\n'
+ '• If you do not want game @ mentions at all (for any game community), please add yourself to the role @no_mentions. If you do not, and officer will be adding you to any community we see you active in.\n\n'

  let embedsPing = '**• Winter Community Video and Link Embeds:** If you are rank: Member or above, you can embed videos and links. Use your best judgment when posting links. If the embed image or video thumbnail is even remotely questionable or NSFW, your post will be deleted. If you want to post a link without the embed, wrap the link in angle brackets `like this: <https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ>`'

  let guidelinesPing = '**• THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITY GUIDELINES WILL BE ENFORCED FOR ALL WINTER MEMBERS REGARDLESS OF RANK OR POSITION**\n\n'

+ '**Constructive Discussion** - Please keep public comments and discussions constructive. If you feel like a conversation you\'re having might be inappropriate for public discussion, or if someone tells you it definitely is, please move it to your DMs.\n\n'
+ '**SFW Policy** - Many community members keep their Discord chats open at work or on family computers. Please keep general content SFW.\n\n'
+ '**Hate Speech** - Winter does not tolerate attacks on any person or group of people on the basis of gender, religion, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. *This includes the casual use of derogatory terms.*\n\n'
+ '**Harassment** - Do not engage in or post content encouraging the harassment of individuals or communities.\n\n'
+ '**Politics, Religion & Finances** - Do not post about these at all. Period.\n\n'
+ '**Voice Channels** - Voice channels are reserved for community members gaming *together* or participating in community social events. In order to keep as many channels available as possible, we ask that members *do not hang out in Gaming channels alone.*\n\n'
+ '***Violation of community guidelines may result in your removal from the Winter server and possible reporting to Discord.***\n\n'
+ 'Guidelines are subject to change at the discretion of Winter community leadership. If you have any questions about the community guidelines, please **DM** ' + `${samzID}` + '.\n\n'
+ 'You can find the official Discord Community Guidelines here: <https://discordapp.com/guidelines>\n\n'

  let spamPing = '**• Winter Community Spam Policy:** As a courtesy to others in the server, we ask that users avoid spamming. This includes excessive use of emojis and/or multiple consecutive uses of public winter-bot commands (target, show me love, highfive, etc). If you\'re receiving this message, someone thinks you\'ve crossed into the "excessive" zone. Some of your past "spammy" messages might be deleted... especially if they are of the "Ouch! My eyes!!" variety :)'
