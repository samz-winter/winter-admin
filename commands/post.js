+ '**SFW Policy** - Many community members keep their Discord chats open at work or on family computers. Please keep general content SFW.\n\n'
+ '**Hate Speech** - Winter does not tolerate attacks on any person or group of people on the basis of gender, religion, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. *This includes the casual use of derogatory terms.*\n\n'

+ '**Politics, Religion & Finances** - Do not post about these at all. Period.\n\n'
+ '**Advertising** -  Do not use the Winter server to promote or sell your product or service. Posts attempting to solicit anything will be removed.\n\n'
+ '**Voice Channels** - Voice channels are reserved for community members gaming *together* or participating in community social events. If you are not actively gaming *with someone else* please use one of the Lobby, LFG, or AFK channels.\n\n'
+ '***Violation of community guidelines may result in your removal from the Winter server and possible reporting to Discord.***\n\n'
+ `Guidelines are subject to change at the discretion of Winter community leadership. If you have any questions about the community guidelines, please **DM** ${samzID}.\n\n`

This invite directs new members to our cool ${welcomeChat} channel which acts as a splash page for the clan and server. From there, they can click through to any other public channel.\n\n`
+ '**This is the only invite link for the server.** If you see anyone in the clan asking for an invite link, direct them here. This link will be refreshed every now and then for security. Check back before sharing.\n\n'

We currently support a variety of games on both PC and PlayStation, and maintain this Discord server for communication, planning and hanging out.\n\n'
+ `**Guidelines** - We like a bit of good-natured ribbing, but we\'re not savages. You can find our full community guidelines posted in the ${guidelinesChat} channel, but the short version is "Don\'t be a dick."\n\n`
+ `**winter-bot** - The Winter server uses a custom bot to manage user-joinable roles (game communities) and provide some comic relief now and then. You can find more information about how to use winter-bot in the ${botHelpChat} channel, or you can DM ${winterBot} with the word "help"\n\n`
+ '**Game Communities** - Winter encourages members to organize into communities based on the games they play. Active games with a reasonable community size will usually have their own text channel, and each community has at least one Captain who acts as the advocate, recruiter and organizer.\n'
+ '• All server users need to add themselves to at least one community role. This allows the community captains to @ mention the community as a whole for important updates.\n'
+ '• If you do not want game @ mentions at all (for any game community), please add yourself to the role @no_mentions. If you do not, an officer will be adding you to any community they see you active in.\n'
+ `• **For instructions on how to add yourself to a community, send a direct message to** ${winterBot} **with the word "games".**\n\n`
